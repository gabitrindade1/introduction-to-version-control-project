This project was written as a prerequisite to conclude Udacity’s Programming for Data Science with Python nanodegree program. It uses Python to answer some questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities, Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The code was written to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive experience in the terminal that presents the answers to user’s questions.

### Software required
* Python 3
* A text editor, such as VSCode or Atom
* A terminal application

### Files used
* bikeshare.py
* chicago.csv
* washington.csv
* new-york-city.csv
